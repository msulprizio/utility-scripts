README

The files in this directory can be used to set up a 1-year benchmark run
directory. Follow these steps:

   1. Create a geosfp_4x5_fullchem_benchmark run directory

   2. Copy the setup_1yr_run script from this directory into your newly
      created run directory

   3. Open setup_1yr_run and modify BM_VERSION, START_YR, START_MONTH, N_MONTHS
      as needed

   4. Make sure the latest code updated have been pulled into Code.$GC_VERSION
      (or change the line in setup_1yr_run under "Copy code directory" to point
      to your code directory)

   5. Execute "./setup_1yr_run"
